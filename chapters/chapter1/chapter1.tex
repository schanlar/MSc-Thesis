    \chapter{Introduction}
    
		The cycle of life and death of stars  baffled astronomers for many years. The study of stellar structure and evolution continue to be of paramount importance up to this date, since it is crucial to our understanding of various branches of astronomy, e.g. the structure of galaxies, and chemical history of the Universe.
		
		A detailed coverage of the principles of stellar evolution is beyond the scope of this thesis. Moreover, for the interested reader, there are excellent classical textbooks \citep{Kipp_book, Clayton} covering almost every aspect in the field of stellar astrophysics. Nevertheless, for the sake of completeness, a small introduction to several fundamental notions, tailored to our needs, will be attempted in the next few paragraphs. 
		
    
    
    \section{Helium stars}
    	
    	A brief explanation of what a helium star is


			\subsection{Formation of Helium stars}
			
				A small section explaining how helium stars are being formed
				
			
			\subsection{Evolution of single Helium stars}
			
				A small section explaining the evolution of single helium stars    	
				
					\subsubsection{Mixing mechanisms}
					
						convection, overshooting, thermohaline
						
					\subsubsection{Effects of rotation}
					
						Rotational mixing 
						
						
					\subsubsection{Transportation of angular momentum}
					
						Eddington-Sweet circulation etc
						
					\subsubsection{Winds and mass loss}
					
						Importance of mass loss in the evolution of stellar winds and Wolf-Rayet stars + magnetic braking --> connection to angular momentum losses.
						
					
				
	\section{Evolution of binary systems}
	
		Few words about how most stars form in binary systems, detached, semi-detached and contact binaries
		
			\subsection{Interaction and orbital parameters}
			
				Cases A/B/C etc
