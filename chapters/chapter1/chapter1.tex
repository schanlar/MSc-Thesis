    \chapter{Introduction}
    
		A detailed coverage of the principles of stellar evolution is beyond the scope of this thesis. Moreover, for the interested reader, there are excellent textbooks (cite Kippenhahn, Clayton) covering every aspect in the field of stellar astrophysics. Nevertheless, for the sake of completeness, a small introduction to several fundamental parameters, tailored to our needs, will be attempted in the next few paragraphs. 
		
    
    
    \section{Helium stars}
    	
    	A brief explanation of what a helium star is


			\subsection{Formation of Helium stars}
			
				A small section explaining how helium stars are being formed
				
			
			\subsection{Evolution of single Helium stars}
			
				A small section explaining the evolution of single helium stars    	
				
					\subsubsection{Mixing mechanisms}
					
						convection, overshooting, thermohaline
						
					\subsubsection{Effects of rotation}
					
						Rotational mixing
